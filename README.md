## Submission Guidelines

Participating in the hackathon is as easy as contributing to an open source project on GitHub. Exactly so, because you will register your project by creating an issue in this repository, and submit it by creating a pull request.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

### The Submission Process

#### 1) Create an issue

The first step is to fill out our google form below with the necessary information. After you hit the submission an issue will be created in our github repository with your idea and team members. 

Here people can view the current ideas and will be the official submission process for projects. 

Upon submission you are agreeing to that your project will remain as open source under one of the licenses listed here [Open Source Licences](https://opensource.org/licenses)

#### 2) Colloboration

Use your issue to talk with collaborators, brainstorm, and organize. Check out the other issues to see if there are participants who want to work on the same things.

Members of the lifescihack team will be able to point other participants to your issue (if it looks like they can help), help you with technical questions, or just offer support :)

Issue events will also be pulled into the Slack feed [Slack](lifescihack2019.slack.com) which is a better place for more general discussion and chatting in the `#active-projects` channel! 


#### 3) Build with LifeSciHack 2019

Work on your project as you like. How you work is up to you; We recommend creating a new GitHub repo for your team. Remember to only begin working on your project after the hackathon begins on October 22nd!

Use the issue you created in step 1 to let others know where your project lives. You might want discuss any technical challenges or attract additional teammembers.

Wherever you work, remember that your project must include an **Open Source License** of [some form](https://opensource.org/licenses), and should be accessible to everyone after the submission deadline.


#### 4) Fork and PR
When you feel ready to submit, create a new fork of the LifeSciHack repo, and add your project as a markdown file inside `LifeSciHack2019/submissions/`.

You can find the fork button at the top right of this repo.

You can use `submissions/EXAMPLE.md` as a template if you like for what your project would look like.

When you are ready to submit your file you will open up a new pull request:

Here you can view the changes you've made to the file and how you will be submitting your project

Be sure that your project's folder links to the repo you've been working in, and contains any other supporting materials that you want evaluated by judges (such as links to a pitch deck or demo video).

Once ready, submit via a new [pull request](https://github.com/LifeSciHack/LifeSciHack2019/pulls).

*Opening a Pull Request establishes your project as an "official" submission*

You can open a PR before the submission deadline and continue to work, but all materials must be finalized *before* the end of the hackathon. Any commits to your project submission after the deadline will not be considered.

We'd also recommend referencing the issue you created in step 1 [using keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) in your PR.

**Submit your pull request before the submission deadline: _February 3, 12:00 CST_**

###3 5) Congratulate your team (and yourself) on a job well-done
Whether or not you get a prize, you deserve to be proud of your work. Thanks for participating in the hackathon!
